v0.3 release 2013-09-08

    + major overhaul of codebase, should allow for easier extensibility
    + added sorting to user profile tabs, ie following, followers, sets, likes, comments, groups
    + sorting actions should be relevant to current set of items
        - ie when looking at a list of users/groups, sort actions for sounds are not shown
    + removed sorting by Duration, looks like SoundCloud changed how they present this information
        - need to come up with alternative way of retrieving that data, if at all possible.
    + minor performance improvements
