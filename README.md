Sound Cloud Sorter
================

Chrome Extension adding sorting options to the search results.
[Chrome Extension Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/soundcloud-sorter/nligpjaegfdmckodpadnlhpbjimpiclp)

Currently can sort by

	Title
	Date
	Plays
	Likes
	Reposts
	Comments
	Duration
	Tags
	
Works best with the Sounds search page. If there are any bugs or feature requests, submit an issue.

Thanks to [Swader](https://github.com/Swader/ChromeSkel_a) for the chrome extension skeleton.
